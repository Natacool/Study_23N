        <p>A bicycle, also called a pedal cycle, bike, push-bike or cycle, is a human-powered or motor-powered assisted,
            pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other. A bicycle
            rider is called a cyclist, or bicyclist.

        <p>The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing
            modern industrial methods. Several components that played a key role in the development of the automobile
            were
            initially invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings, pneumatic tires, chain-driven sprockets
            and
            tension-spoked wheels.

        <p>Bicycles can be categorized in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general
            construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include utility bicycles, mountain
            bicycles, racing bicycles, touring bicycles, hybrid bicycles, cruiser bicycles, and BMX bikes. Less common
            are tandems, low riders, tall bikes, fixed gear, folding models, amphibious bicycles, cargo bikes,
            recumbents and electric bicycles.
